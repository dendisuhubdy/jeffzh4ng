### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fullstack software engineer focused on Typescript. Currently learning Rust. Interested in all things computer science. When I'm not coding, I try my best to finish my Bachelors degree in Mathematics at the University of Waterloo.

Previously interned at IBM. I worked on some core data analytics for IBM Watson's risk management. After, I interned as a full stack engineer for eight months at a Sequoia-backed startup, Setter. I was a core member on the team, heavily contributing to the sucess of our series B funding.

I'm currently open for internship opportunities, feel free to email me at zhang.jeffreyd@gmail.com
